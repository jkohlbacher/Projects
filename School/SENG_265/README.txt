A1: Takes one of the XML files and a range of dates then prints out all events within that range in the required format. The tests provide an example of the required format
A2: Same idea as A1 but in python and we were not allowed to use certain libraries that would make certain tasks ,like parsing the XML, trivial. 
A3 Same idea as A1 and A2 but back in C and with further requirements that made the data harder to parse. The textbook implementation of a linked list in C was provided and used as part of the solution. 
A4: It was required to structure the programs in such a way that everything was connected to a python class. It uses random numbers to generate simple html art.
