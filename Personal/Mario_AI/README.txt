A reinforcement learning algorithim trained to play Super Mario Bros
Followed this tutorial to set it up:

The goal of the project is to build upon what was demonstrated in the tutorial
and eventually have a model that beats the entire game as fast as possible. 

The set up process was suprisingly challenging.
In the time since the tutorial was made a lot of the libraries used recieved updates 
that made them incompatible with each other. So trying to track down the 
correct versions and get it to all to work within an Anaconda environment was
a good learning experience. 

The current model can beat the first level and took roughly 10 hours to train
using a NVIDIA RTX 3060.
