A few simple scripts I wrote to simplify my work at Deploy Online. 
They were for my own personal use and I never ended up needing to share them with anyone else at the company so they are a little messy.
They use a Pipedrive API wrapper library that I found online. 
Pipedrive was the primary CRM software developer that Deploy worked with.
